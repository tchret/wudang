  program_title_method: The method
  program_paragraph_method: 'According to Tang Li Long the traditional way of Wudang, Wudang Pai has to posses 3 elements, the internal work and health benefits, the daoistic principles and the martial application. If one or two of them are missing, it is not Wudang Pai. Tang Li Long teachings builds from the 10 daoistic principles of Wudang, which contains the daoistic manual of internal cultivation, the meta-structure and narrative of the world and the fighting principles of Wudang Pai. This makes our way seem slow and unstructured but in-fact it is progressive and profound. The focus is on the internal work and to make the body move as one, where the Bufa (foot skills), Shenfa (body skills) and Shoufa (hand skills) will not be separated and the Shen will manifest in the movements. The method will give you the structure and from this structure your physical body shape, Qi and Shen (your “being”), will determine the path you walk and how your expression will look like. In the end our movements will be just a natural respond to our surrounding. Some people like this way and some people don’t, it demands patience and trust. This means that beside the external and internal cultivation there is also, inside the teachings, a self-cultivation of your personality. So, please ask yourself if this is really what you want, if the answer is no, there are many other schools you can turn to. If your answer is yes, please contact us for more information!'

  xuan_wu_pai_title_1: The Zhang San Feng legacy
  xuan_wu_pai_paragraph_1: Almost 800 years after Zhang San Feng was preaching the texts of the Dao De Jing at the “Wu Long Gong” (“The Palace/ Temple of the five Dragons”) in Wudang Shan, his legacy lives on. Preserved throughout the history by Daoist scholars and revolutionary heroes, the Wudang Martial Arts are as strong as ever. The entire system was passed on from generation to generation of disciples which made it hard to trace during the centuries. The culture of Wudang Shan had it´s moments of flourishing and it´s moments of being close to extinction. There fore the unique arts of Wudang Shan are now open to public so that the knowledge can spread and live on forever. At the beginning San Feng had a humble amount of disciples who followed him to live in huts around early temples of the mountain. They were studying the stars, Energy, Medicine and Martial Arts forming the legacy we still keep alive to this very day. Based om the Daoist Principles, the knowledge about Yin and Yang, the Five Element Theory and the martial heritage of the Song Shan “Shaolin Temple” a movement grew strong. A movement that would change the world of martial arts forever. All the modern forms of Taiji Quan, Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and Baji Quan were born out of this movement and Wudang Shan was, and still is, the place for people to gather and practice those martial arts as well as self cultivation.
  xuan_wu_pai_title_2: The Xuan Wu Pai
  xuan_wu_pai_paragraph_2: In the Yong Le period of the Ming Dynasty (1413) the emperor ordered to start a giant construction project at Wudang Shan. Zhang Yu Qing, a Daoist from the Zheng Yi Sect, acted upon the order and called more than 500 Daoists from nearby provinces to follow him to Mt. Wudang. Among them around 20 were assigned with important duties and positions in many different temples. All of them considered Zhen Wu to be the common deity and Zhang San Feng to be the founder of their movement. Therefore people called them Zhen Wu Xuan Wu Sect. In 1989, upon the common understanding, the Daoism association agreed to change the name of the sect intoo “Wudang Xuan Wu Sect”. This sect boasts lots of classics, among them the Zhen WU Cannon remains the mainstay. “Zhang San Feng transmitted his knowledge to Lu Qiu Yun, Liu Gu Quan, Yang San Cheng, Zhou Zhen De, Li Xing Zhi, Qiu Xuan Qing. Li Xing Zhi also transferred his knowledge to Zhi Dao Ren, Shu Fu Chu; Qiu Xuan Qing to Yan Shan Ming, Pu Shan Yuan, Ma Shang Ning, etc.” The Daoism Sects Chronicles, a ancient book circulating the Wudang area, has the recording that the Wudang Pai had eight branches. Xuan Wu Pai is one of those branches.
  xuan_wu_pai_title_3: You Xuan De
  xuan_wu_pai_paragraph_3: Daoist Master You Xuan De is now the 14th generation headmaster of the Wudang Xuan Wu Pai. Ascending from a family with strong martial history, You Xuan De has been practicing martial arts since childhood. When he turned 18 he was already assisting his father training the Chinese Special Forces. Even though his knowledge was already on an advanced level, he left home to seek even more guidance by great masters. After achieving the real Wudang Boxing from Wang Wei Shen, the inheritor of Wudang Songxi Pai, he was strongly recommended to go and learn at the original place of Wudang martial arts – Wudang Shan. At the mountain his teachers were all foremost Wudang Daoist Tong Shen Wang (a hermit at Wudang Temple), Zhu Cheng De (Daoist headmaster) and Lu Ming Dao (who lived more than 100 years). During the 1990´s he did a lot of exhibitions and shows and helped spreading the Wudang culture all over China. His teachings are based on Daoist principles and Chinese Medicine. Every movement has a practical application which underlines the heritage of Wudang Pai as an effective martial/ fighting art. Grand Master You Xuan De is now resident at Nan Wudang Shan close to Wuhan.
