  program_title_method: The method
  program_paragraph_method: 'According to Tang Li Long the traditional way of Wudang, Wudang Pai has to posses 3 elements, the internal work and health benefits, the daoistic principles and the martial application. If one or two of them are missing, it is not Wudang Pai. Tang Li Long teachings builds from the 10 daoistic principles of Wudang, which contains the daoistic manual of internal cultivation, the meta-structure and narrative of the world and the fighting principles of Wudang Pai. This makes our way seem slow and unstructured but in-fact it is progressive and profound. The focus is on the internal work and to make the body move as one, where the Bufa (foot skills), Shenfa (body skills) and Shoufa (hand skills) will not be separated and the Shen will manifest in the movements. The method will give you the structure and from this structure your physical body shape, Qi and Shen (your “being”), will determine the path you walk and how your expression will look like. In the end our movements will be just a natural respond to our surrounding. Some people like this way and some people don’t, it demands patience and trust. This means that beside the external and internal cultivation there is also, inside the teachings, a self-cultivation of your personality. So, please ask yourself if this is really what you want, if the answer is no, there are many other schools you can turn to. If your answer is yes, please contact us for more information!'
